## Application (15 points)

*Failure to use functions taught in class and opting for base R or AI solutions will result in an automatic deduction from each application in which it is used.*

<br>

The following applications use the `survey_sample` dataset which has been preloaded for you.

This is a **random sample** taken from our population: **Northwestern Students who take STAT 202**.

<br>

**NA values should NOT be included in the total count (`n`) of a proportion because we do not know what category they would fall in and it would skew our proportion.**

<br>

If for some reason you are not able to complete the code to obtain the results it would be wise to still interpret your problem with 'placeholder' values for partial credit.

<br>

### Application 1 (3 points)

*You do not need the dataset for this application.*

Suppose the number of minutes that a student athlete exercises each week follows a normal distribution with mean 500 and sd 100. 

What proportion of athletes exercise **between** 350 and 650 minutes?

```{r App1a, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
pnorm(650, mean = 500, sd = 100) - pnorm(350, mean = 500, sd = 100)
```

```{r App1a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

The top 20% of athletes exercise more than how many minutes?

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
qnorm(p = 0.2, mean = 500, sd = 100, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

```{r App1b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```


### Application 2 (6 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining the difference in the average number of parties that students who take STAT 202 and live on `North campus` go to and the average number of parties that students who take STAT 202 and live on `South campus` go to.

In other words, use the `campus_housing` and `num_party` variables in the `survey_sample` data to **construct a 98% confidence interval** for the difference in means. 

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
north <- survey_sample |> 
  filter(campus_housing == "North campus")

south <- survey_sample |> 
  filter(campus_housing == "South campus")

t.test(x = north$num_party, south$num_party, conf.level = 0.98)
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```
<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem. Then use the confidence interval to answer and explain: is there a difference in means, if so, do students who live on North or South campus attend more parties?

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 3 (6 points)

A national survey reports that 12% of Americans are `Very happy`. Is the proportion of students who take STAT 202 who report being `Very happy` more than the national survey?

Use the `survey_sample` data and `happy` variable to conduct a hypothesis test for the proportion of students who take STAT 202 at NU who are `Very happy` at the $\alpha$ = 0.10 significance level.


$$H_0: \pi_{veryhappy} = 0.12$$
$$H_A: \pi_{veryhappy} \ne 0.12$$

```{r App3, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey_sample |> 
  count(happy)

prop.test(x = 39, n = 250, p = .12, conf.level = 0.9, correct = FALSE)
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

<br>

State your p-value and interpret your decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App3-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```
